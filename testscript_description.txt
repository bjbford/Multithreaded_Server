Attached is the test script for project 2.

To use:
Download test script
cd to the directory the test script was saved to
Run command:  chmod u+x ./testscript.pl

To run the script use the command:
./testscriptF11.pl ./appserver [numThreads] [numAccounts] [seed]
For example, a test with 10 threads, 1000 accounts, and a seed of 0 would be:
./testscriptF11.pl ./appserver 10 1000 0

If the test fails, you should receive some message "ERR: <error message>" at the end of the script output.
The script will operate as follows:
Step 1:  1000000 is added to every account
             Then the script waits to allow your server to process all these requests
Step 2:  300 random transactions occur (these are based off the seed value provided)
             The script then waits to allow your server to process all the requests
Step 3:  The balance of every account is checked, followed by an END command
             The script then waits for your server to finish
Step 4:   The script checks the output file  (which is stored in testout-xxx, where xxx is some number)
              and reports back if it finds and discrepancies.

In some cases if the tested program does not process transactions as fast as expected step four will start before step three has finished causing the test script to report a failure.  If this is the case increase the $testSleepTime variable on line 31 of the test script.
